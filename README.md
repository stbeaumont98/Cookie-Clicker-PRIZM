# Cookie-Clicker-PRIZM
A port of [Ortiel's Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) for the Casio PRIZM line of calculators, originally developed over 10 years ago. Now updated to include all the buildings of the official version of the game, with simplified graphics to save space, and a new stats screen to view the progress you've made! Buildings also now unlock incrementally, as they do in the official version.

In case it wasn't clear, the concept and modified sprites were created by [Ortiel](https://orteil.dashnet.org/). I'm just a fan of the game and wanted to create a version for my calculator!
